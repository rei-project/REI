# REI
Design artifacts and the philosophical core/framework identity

---

## Overview

REI is a web framework designed for environments where **language models are active participants** in system construction, inspection, and evolution.

It is inspired by stack-based execution models, compositional semantics, and virtual machines that favor **explicit state** over hidden abstraction.

REI is not optimized for human ergonomics.  
It is optimized for **mechanical clarity**.

Humans can read REI systems.  
Machines are expected to write them.

---

## Design Position

REI makes the following assumptions:

- execution is compositional  
- state must be visible  
- code and data are interchangeable  
- systems must explain themselves at runtime  

These assumptions shape all design decisions.

---

## Non-Goals

REI does **not** aim to provide:

- friendly error messages  
- colorful terminal output  
- opinionated project structure  
- implicit magic  
- onboarding tutorials  

If a system cannot be reasoned about without hand-holding, it is not suitable for REI.

---

## Execution Model

REI follows a **stack-oriented execution model**.

Programs are composed from small executable units (“words”) that operate on explicit data structures.

There is no hidden control flow.  
There is no implicit state.

What executes is what is visible.

---

## Abstractions

REI intentionally keeps abstractions shallow.

Higher-level behavior is expressed through **composition**, not inheritance or deep type hierarchies.

If an abstraction cannot be decomposed into executable primitives, it does not belong in the core.

---

## AI-First Orientation

REI assumes that:

- code will be generated by language models  
- code will be inspected by language models  
- systems will be modified while running  

Syntax, structure, and execution semantics prioritize **predictability and inspectability** over readability.

Human readability is a side effect, not a requirement.

---

## Virtual Machine

REI is designed to run on a dedicated virtual machine.

The VM defines:
- execution semantics  
- memory boundaries  
- introspection capabilities  

This boundary is intentional.  
It is what allows safe observation and controlled evolution of live systems.

---

## Observability

Every REI system is expected to be observable.

State inspection is not a debugging feature.  
It is part of normal operation.

Systems that cannot report their current condition are considered incomplete.

---

## Documentation Style

REI documentation is reference material.

It describes:
- what exists  
- what executes  
- what is allowed  

It does not explain *why* you might want it.

If you are looking for tutorials, REI is not the correct tool.

---

## Status

REI is under active development.

Interfaces may change.  
Semantics are expected to stabilize before ergonomics.

---

## Closing Note

REI does not attempt to be welcoming.

It does not compete for attention.

It exists to be:
- precise  
- inspectable  
- mechanically honest  

If this feels quiet, that is intentional.
